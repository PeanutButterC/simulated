### How to download
*In progress:* The data is available at https://plunarlabcit.services.brown.edu/simulated/

All the videos are there right now (under videos/). If you need the trajectory data, let me know and I'll add it.

### How to use
*In progress:* For a demonstration of how to load and handle the data, see the notebooks in the **demo** folder.

All research code is in the research folder. It's currently a garden path of messy research code, which I'm refactoring.
